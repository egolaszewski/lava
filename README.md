This project was conceived as an educational, hands-on experience with the inner workings of a language like LISP. It implements the minimal LISP, assuming the following functions:
```
quote
atom
cons
car
cdr
cond
```

One of the self-imposed challenges was to implement this using object oriented design, motivating the selection of Java as the host language.
